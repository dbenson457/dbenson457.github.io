			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS AN INVESTMENT?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  
				<p>An investment is a way of putting money away, with the hope that the amount will increase over time. For most people, investments are made in the stock market (buying shares in companies) but some of the other most common investments include:</p>

				<ul>
	              <li class="list-item">Corporate Bonds</li>
	              <li class="list-item">Investment Funds</li>
	              <li class="list-item">Units Trusts or OEICs</li>
	              <li class="list-item">Government bonds (gilts) </li>
	              <li class="listitem">Property (commercial or residential)</li>
	            </ul>

			<button class="accordion">HOW IS AN INVESTMENT DIFFERENT TO SAVING?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Investing is more risky than saving. With savings, you have the security of earning steady returns - through interest payments - but with investments, you take a risk on whether you make a profit or loss. A person should only invest if they are prepared to take the risk that their investments could go down, as well as up, in value.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS A STOCKS AND SHARES ISA?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Stocks and shares individual saving accounts (ISAs) are also known as equity ISAs. They are a tax-efficient way of investing in a range of stock market related assets and offer the possibility of higher returns than a cash ISA.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">HOW DO STOCK MARKETS WORK?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The stock market is where different company shares (very small percentages of ownership) are listed, sold and bought. Companies sell shares in a bid to boost funds available to invest, by offering investors the chance to back them financially. The shareholder then gains returns on the business profits (via dividend and changes in the share value) - but if the company makes losses, the shareholder potentially will as well.</p>
				<p>Share prices continually rise and fall. This can be dictated by a number of factors, including the company’s financial performance and the general economic position in any one country or globally.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">WHAT INVESTMENT IS BEST FOR ME?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The best investment for an individual depends on their personal finances and circumstances. Choosing the right product is a crucial part of creating a robust investment plan so it’s important that the investor seeks quality financial advice.</p>
				<p>Navigate Wealth’s experienced team will complete an extensive review of your finances and circumstances before making any investment recommendations. To discuss your personal situation, contact the team on <a href="#">0345 340 9690</a> or use our <a href="#">submission form.</a></p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS A STOCKS AND SHARES ISA?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				 <p>There is no recommended figure, but it is a common misconception that you should always invest large sums of money. If you are new to investments, as a general rule, you should start by only investing what you can afford to lose.</p>
				<p>Investors who consistently invest small sums can be just as successful than those who invest lump sums. These smaller investments can be gradually increased to larger sums over time.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR ME TO PROFIT FROM MY INVESTMENT?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>There is no guarantee that you will make a profit when you make an investment, but it is recommended that you invest for as long a period of time as possible to increase your chances as much as possible. </p>
				<p>For example, with stocks and shares investments, a minimum five year investment period should allow enough time for a company to recover from any dips in profits/share value.</p>

			<h3>Retirement</h3>
			<p>Regardless of the life stage you have arrived at, it’s important to receive the right advice on your pension requirements. We can help you make the most of the retirement opportunities available, whether you're an individual or a business.</p>

			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS A PENSION?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>A pension is a tax-free pot of money that you contribute to throughout your employment. You and your employer make regular payments (most often monthly) into your pension and when you retire, the money is repaid to you in installments.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">WHY DO I NEED A PENSION?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>After retirement, most people are reliant on their pension as a regular source of income. A pension is highly recommended as it takes pressure off you to save for later life while you’re working.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PENSION?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Final salary pensions - sometimes referred to as defined benefit schemes - are largely funded by employers. With this pension, you get a percentage of your final salary before retirement, or when leaving the company, as an annual income.</p>
				<p>Money purchase pensions - also known as defined contribution schemes - are when you save your pension under a ‘money purchase arrangement’. The amount you’ve saved can then be withdrawn or swapped for an annuity - an income for life. Most personal pensions are saved for by this method, which includes; workplace, trust-based, group personal, stakeholder, and self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs).</p>
				<p>State pension - this is where you get a small pension (currently £155.60 per week) from the government when you reach retirement age. You build up entitlement to the state pension by paying national insurance throughout your working life.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">HOW MUCH SHOULD I PAY INTO MY PENSION?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>When auto-enrolled into a pension plan, there is usually a minimum percentage that you have to contribute, dependent on the provider - but if you can afford to pay more, it is recommended that you do.</p>
				<p>As a rule of thumb, you should take the age that you start your pension and halve it - this is the percentage of your pre-tax salary that you should put aside each year until you retire, including your employer’s contribution.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">CAN I TRANSFER MY PENSION?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>You can transfer most pensions, but it is highly recommended that you seek financial advice before doing so to ensure you’re making the right decision. There may also be different restrictions on the different pensions you have, dependent on the type and the provider.</p>
				<p>You’ll find more information on consolidating pensions on our dedicated page, or you can get in touch with a member of our team on <a href="#">0345 340 9690</a> to discuss your specific circumstances.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">HOW DO I TAKE MY PENSION?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>There is a lot of flexibility around how you can take your pension, but you cannot take any money until you are 55. You can choose to buy an annuity - a guaranteed income for life, or you can use it to provide a drawdown - a flexible retirement income.</p>
				<p>You can also choose to take small cash lump sums, take the whole amount as cash, leave it untouched or mix some of these options. The best option for you will depend on your retirement plans.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion">CAN I TAKE MY PENSION BEFORE I RETIRE?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Once you are 55, you can choose to take your pension but still carry on working. You can also continue paying into your pension without paying tax until you are 75.</p>
				<p>Any amount you withdraw from your pension over 25% will be taxed, and it is recommended that you still leave enough money in your pension for when you do retire.</p>
				<p>It is also possible to access your pension before you are 55, but it is not advisable as it comes at a significant cost. The company that acts on your behalf will charge around 30% of the amount you’re withdrawing from your pension as an administration fee and on top of this, you will have to pay 55% tax on the amount you withdraw.</p>

			<h3>Family Protection</h3>
			<p>We are specialists in providing effective solutions to meet the insurance and protection needs of our clients. Whether you require life cover or advice on Inheritance Tax, Exchequer Wealth Management will offer you the right products and services to suit you and your family.</p>

			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS INCOME PROTECTION INSURANCE?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Income protection insurance is a long-term insurance policy designed to help if you are unwell or injured over a long-term basis. Such policies ensure that you will still receive a regular income until you retire or are able to return to work. </p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">WHY DO I NEED INCOME PROTECTION INSURANCE?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>It helps to ensure you do not fall behind with your monthly bills - including your mortgage - if you are ever unable to work for a long period of time due to illness, injury or disability.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS INCOME PROTECTION INSURANCE?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Income protection insurance is a long-term insurance policy designed to help if you are unwell or injured over a long-term basis. Such policies ensure that you will still receive a regular income until you retire or are able to return to work. </p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">CAN I GET INCOME PROTECTION INSURANCE IF I AM SELF-EMPLOYED?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>If you are self-employed, you can still take out income protection insurance. However, you may want to select a policy by which you can start to receive payments from as early as possible if you become unwell.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">WHY IS LIFE INSURANCE IMPORTANT?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>People usually take out life insurance because they wish to provide financial protection for their loved ones in the event of their death. This could be used to pay off a mortgage or to provide a fixed-income or lump sum for their family.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">DO I NEED LIFE INSURANCE TO TAKE OUT A MORTGAGE?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Mortgages are a long-term financial commitment, and for many people, account for the single largest purchase they will ever make. With this in mind, it is important to consider how you would maintain future mortgage payments, should you suffer a loss of income or in the event of your death.</p>
				<p>Income protection, critical illness or life insurance can provide peace of mind that could prevent you or your family from losing a property.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">HOW MUCH LIFE INSURANCE PROTECTION DO I NEED?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The amount of cover you will need depends on your individual circumstances. In the event that you have a large mortgage and a big family, it makes sense to have more cover than if you have a small mortgage and small family.</p>
				<p>Speak to your financial adviser about how much you would need based on your individual needs.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE INSURANCE AND CRITICAL ILLNESS INSURANCE?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Life insurance and critical illness cover are sometimes sold together, but they are not the same thing. Critical illness insurance can be added to a life insurance policy, but can also be sold as a standalone plan.</p>
				<p>Life insurance will only be paid out in the event of the death of the person insured, whereas critical illness policies will pay the benefit if you are diagnosed with one of a number of medical conditions outlined in the policy.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">WHAT IS CLASSED AS A CRITICAL ILLNESS?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  
				<p>The types of critical illness that you can be insured against include:</p>

				<ul>
	              <li class="list-item">Heart disease </li>
	              <li class="list-item">Cancer - of various types and stages </li>
	              <li class="list-item">Stroke</li>
	              <li class="list-item">Multiple Sclerosis</li>
	            </ul>

	            <p>Not all medical conditions are covered by critical illness policies, and some state how serious a condition must be before paying out, so it is important that you understand a policy before you commit. </p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">CAN I INSURE MY PARTNER?</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Many couples choose to take out joint life insurance as the premiums for joint cover can be less than they are individually. However, joint policies only pay out once, in the event of the first death. If the surviving partner then wants to arrange their own policy, it is likely to be more expensive because they will be older. </p>
			</div>

			<button class="accordion">WHAT FACTORS AFFECT INSURANCE CALCULATIONS?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  
				<p>The monthly costs of insurance vary considerably and are dependent on a range of factors, including:</p>

				<ul>
	              <li class="list-item">Your age</li>
	              <li class="list-item">Your health - including your weight, current health and medical history</li>
	              <li class="list-item">Whether you smoke or have previously smoked</li>
	              <li class="list-item">Your job</li>
	              <li class="listitem">The length of your policy</li>
	              <li class="listitem">The amount of money you wish to cover</li>
	            </ul>
	            
				<p>The younger and the better health you are in, the less you can expect your policy to cost.</p>
